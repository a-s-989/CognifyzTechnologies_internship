This repository contains three Machine Learning projects focused on restaurant data analysis.

## Projects

1. **Restaurant Rating Predictor**
   - Predicts restaurant ratings using features like cuisines, cost, votes, and delivery options.
   - Uses RandomForestRegressor and feature importance visualization.

2. **Restaurant Recommendation System**
   - Content-based recommendation using cosine similarity.
   - Recommends restaurants based on user preferences (cuisine, price, rating, popularity).

3. **Cuisine Classification**
   - Classifies restaurants into cuisines using RandomForestClassifier.
   - Provides confusion matrix and feature importance analysis.
